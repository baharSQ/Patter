This study focuses on evaluation of Histone Modification which has influence on gene regulation
significantly. The given data set contains number of genes specified with gene ID in where each
gene includes one hundred bins. Mentioned Histone Modification Marks (HMM) are located in
the bins (each five HMM in one bin).
The purpose of this investigation is to experiment variety of algorithms in order to reach the
most accurate solution in gene prediction. Several different algorithms have been implemented
in python.
